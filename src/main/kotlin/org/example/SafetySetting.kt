 * includes both the category of harm to be considered and the threshold for action or concern.
 *
 * @property category The [HarmCategory] indicating the type of potential harm this setting applies to.
 * @property threshold The [Threshold] indicating the minimum level of probability at which content
 *                     in the specified harm category should be considered actionable or concerning.
